- Introduction
</br>The project is a route scheduling web application based on a real world scenario. The idea is derived from my open houses visiting experience. Users can select several open houses they plan to see on the website. Then the app can provide a best route that visits most open houses in least driving time according to the open time window, estimated visiting time and location of the open house.
</br>The project integrates with Google Maps API and Redfin real-time open houses data with more than 1M listings. Web is implemented with React and Bootstrap.
